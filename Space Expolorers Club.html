    <p>The Solar System is a vast and complex structure that consists of the Sun, which is a star at its center, and a variety
    of celestial bodies that orbit around it. This includes eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets, asteroids, and
    comets. The four inner planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars—are known as the terrestrial planets due to their rocky
    surfaces. In contrast, the four outer planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—are known as the gas giants (with
    Jupiter and Saturn) and ice giants (with Uranus and Neptune).</p>
    <p>The Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago from a giant cloud of gas and dust. The gravitational pull of the
    Sun keeps the planets in orbit, while the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud contain many smaller objects that also
    contribute to the solar system's dynamics. Each planet has unique characteristics; for example, Jupiter is the largest
    planet and has a Great Red Spot, a massive storm, while Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system. Earth is the only
    known planet to support life, making it a focal point for exploration and research. The study of our Solar System
    continues to reveal the mysteries of its formation and evolution, as well as the potential for life beyond our planet.</p>
